## Description
This is largely a personal research project into the realm of 4-dimensional rendering.

This project will only run on graphics cards that support OpenGL [Direct State Access](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Direct_State_Access) (DSA).

## Tested On
Windows 8.1, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970M.

## To Build
1. Clone this repo.
2. Make sure ðŸ¦€ [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) installed and `cargo` is in your `PATH`.
3. Inside the repo, run: `cargo build --release`.

## Credits
The `.txt` shape files are from Paul Bourke's [website](http://paulbourke.net/geometry/hyperspace/). Eventually, these shapes will (hopefully) be generated procedurally, but for now, they are loaded offline. 

Thanks to the author of [Eusebeia](http://eusebeia.dyndns.org/4d/), [@GSBicalho](https://github.com/GSBicalho), and [@willnode](https://github.com/willnode) for their guidance throughout this project. Their responses to my questions were vital towards my understanding the 4D slicing procedure.
