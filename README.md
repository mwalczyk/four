The `.txt` shape files are from Paul Bourke's [website](http://paulbourke.net/geometry/hyperspace/). Eventually, these shapes will (hopefully) be generated procedurally, but for now, they are loaded offline. 

Thanks to [@GSBicalho](https://github.com/GSBicalho) for his guidance throughout this project. His responses to my questions were vital towards my understanding the 4D slicing procedure.
